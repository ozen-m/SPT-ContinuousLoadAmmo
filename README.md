# Continuous Load Ammo
You are now able to continuously load and unload ammo while outside your inventory!

Walk freely while waiting for your magazines to top up or unload. You may cancel by clicking the left/right mouse buttons (configurable), or by opening your inventory.

### Configuration
In the configuration manager (`F12`)

- The speed limit, as a percentage of the walk speed, set to the player while un/loading ammo. Default is `30%`.
- Allow loading ammo outside the inventory only when Magazine and Ammo is in your Vest, Pockets, or Secure Container. Default is `true`.
- Do not interrupt un/loading ammo when switching inventory tabs (maps tab, tasks tab, etc.) Default is `true`.
- Key used to cancel un/loading ammo outside the inventory. Default is `left and right mouse buttons`.
- Key used to load ammo outside the inventory. Default is `K`.
- Show UI elements outside the inventory. Default is `true`.

### Installation
