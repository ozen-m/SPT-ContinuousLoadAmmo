# Continuous Load Ammo
You are now able to continuously load ammo while outside your inventory!

Walk freely while waiting for your magazines to top up. You may cancel loading ammo by
clicking the left/right mouse buttons, or by opening your inventory.

### Configuration
In the configuration manager (`F12`), you can change the walking speed limit. Default is `30%`.

### Installation
Extract the contents of the .zip archive into your SPT directory.

### Recommended Mods
Mods that alter loading speed, to balance at your own preference.

**Disclaimer:** I will not be held responsible for any injuries that may occur, including but not limited to - tripping over obstacles, bumping into walls, falling into a pit, etc., whilst loading ammo. Please proceed with caution and watch your step.
