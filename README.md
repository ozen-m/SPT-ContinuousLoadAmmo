# Continuous Load Ammo
You are now able to continuously load and unload ammo while outside your inventory!

Walk freely while waiting for your magazines to top up or unload. You may cancel by clicking the left/right mouse buttons (configurable), or by opening your inventory.

### Configuration
In the configuration manager (`F12`)

- The speed limit, as a percentage of the walk speed, set to the player while un/loading ammo. Default is `30%`.
- Allow loading ammo outside the inventory only when Magazine and Ammo is in your Vest, Pockets or Secure Container. Default is `true`.
- Allow top-loading of weapons (Mosin, SKS, etc.) with ammo outside the inventory via this mod. Default is ``false``.
- Key used to cancel un/loading ammo outside the inventory. Default is `left and right mouse buttons`.
- Key used to load ammo outside the inventory. Default is `L`.
- Show UI elements outside the inventory. Default is `true`.

### Installation
Extract the contents of the .zip archive into your SPT directory.

### Recommended Mods
