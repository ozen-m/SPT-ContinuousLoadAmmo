# Continuous Load Ammo
You are now able to continuously load ammo while outside your inventory!

Walk freely while waiting for your magazines to top up. You may cancel loading ammo by
clicking the left/right mouse buttons (configurable), or by opening your inventory.

### Configuration
In the configuration manager (`F12`)

- The speed limit, as a percentage of the walk speed, set to the player while loading ammo. Default is `30%`.
- Allow loading ammo outside the inventory only when Magazine and Ammo is in your Vest or Pockets. Default is `true`.
- Key used to cancel loading ammo outside the inventory. Default is left and right mouse buttons.
- Show UI elements outside the inventory. Default is `true`.

### Installation
Extract the contents of the .zip archive into your SPT directory.

### Recommended Mods
- Mods that alter loading speed, to balance at your own preference.
- [HandsAreNotBusy](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1810-handsarenotbusy/), just in case busy hands happen.
